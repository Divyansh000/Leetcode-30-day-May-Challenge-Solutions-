Project :- Ransom Note

Problem Statement :- Given an arbitrary ransom note string and another string containing letters from all the magazines, write a function 

that will return true if the ransom note can be constructed from the magazines ; otherwise, it will return false.

Each letter in the magazine string can only be used once in your ransom note.

Note :- You may assume that both strings contain only lowercase letters.

Sample TestCases :- canConstruct("a", "b") -> false

canConstruct("aa", "ab") -> false

canConstruct("aa", "aab") -> true

Learning - 1)Here i learned about use of for loops.
           2) predefined functions like find()
           3) Comparison operators
